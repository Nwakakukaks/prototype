# Prototype.ai â€“ Make something people want.

## Why We Built This â€“ A Personal Story

I've failed. Not once, not twiceâ€”but three times.

Each time, I had a startup idea I believed in. I poured in months of effort, thousands of dollars, and countless sleepless nights. Each time, I saw some traction... but ultimately, I failed. Why? Because I was building in the darkâ€”committing resources to ideas that werenâ€™t properly validated.

After my third failure, I realized: **there has to be a better way.** What if builders could validate their ideas BEFORE investing months of time and money? What if they could get real user feedback early, so they only commit to ideas that actually matter?

Thatâ€™s why we built **Prototype.ai** â€“ so no builder has to experience the same pain I did.

## What is Prototype.ai?

**Prototype.ai is the fastest way to turn your idea into a working prototype.**

Forget spending months building something no one wants. With Prototype.ai, you can simply **chat with AI agents**, and theyâ€™ll handle everythingâ€”**from writing smart contracts to designing your UI, launching your project, and gathering real feedback.**

ðŸ”¹ **For Technical & Non-Technical Builders** â€“ Even your grandpa can now build on electronuem blockchain! Just chat with the agents, and theyâ€™ll do the rest.

ðŸ”¹ **Instant Validation** â€“ Launch your v1 to a real audience and see if it has traction before committing serious resources.

ðŸ”¹ **Save Time & Money** â€“ No more wasted months coding something that flops. Build smart, validate early, win big.

## What Can the Agents Do?

Each agent specializes in a different task, working together seamlessly to bring your idea to life:

ðŸ”¹ **Product Manager (Risha):** Breaks down your idea into a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and creates the project scope.

ðŸ”¹ **Software Engineer (Qwen):** Writes **smart contracts, deploys your dApp, builds the frontend, and manages wallets**.

ðŸ”¹ **Market Analyst (Jaden):** Analyzes market trends and suggests features that increase **user adoption**.

ðŸ”¹ **Interface Designer (Pearl):** Creates your projectâ€™s **branding, UI/UX design, and interface**.

ðŸ”¹ **Growth Expert (Monad):** Writes **marketing tweets, engages users, and drives traction**.

### Actions Agents Can Take:

ðŸ”¹ Write and deploy smart contracts

ðŸ”¹ Create and manage ERC20 tokens & NFTs

ðŸ”¹ Generate and manage wallets for each agent

ðŸ”¹ Check wallet balances and transfer tokens

ðŸ”¹ Request funds from users if needed

ðŸ”¹ Create a **PRD document** on Notion

ðŸ”¹ List the project on **Pad19** for beta feedback

ðŸ”¹ Generate a **project logo** and design assets

ðŸ”¹ Write and schedule **tweets** to market the project

ðŸ”¹ Generate and manage **wallets** for each agent

ðŸ”¹ Fetch relevant crypto and DeFi market data for product strategy and positioning

ðŸ”¹ Develop a **UI interface** interface using Next.js

ðŸ”¹ Store and retrieve project assets on **Pinata** (IPFS)

ðŸ”¹ Create **Github Repo** and deploy live projects on **Vercel**

ðŸ”¹ Conduct competitive analysis and recommend **feature improvements**

ðŸ”¹ And more

## Proof of Concept â€“ What Happens Next?

This is a **proof of concept** â€“ but weâ€™re not stopping after the hackathon. Weâ€™ll continue development **immediately after judging** and iterate based on feedback.

**Note:** We wonâ€™t make changes to this repo until judging ends to comply with hackathon rules.

### Our Vision

Weâ€™re not stopping here. Prototype.ai isnâ€™t just a hackathon projectâ€”itâ€™s the future of smart building.

ðŸ”¹ **Product Hunt Launch Incoming!** Weâ€™re taking this to the next level and launching for real.

ðŸ”¹ **Multi-Chain Expansion** â€“ While weâ€™re starting with **Electroneum**, our vision is to expand Prototype.ai to support builders across all blockchains.

ðŸ”¹ **Full Roadmap & Vision Document** â€“ Check out our plans for the future here: [Roadmap](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGhC5FiXtY/WWFHwD917e4UHbJzHB2pBA/edit?utm_content=DAGhC5FiXtY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
